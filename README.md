# Cloud Computing

Cloud Computing part in this project is to set up, manage, deploy and buiild a private API for our application.

## Location API

Our android app needed to display both provinces and cities for user data. We decided to make an API that fetch both provinces data and cities based on provinces id from a MySQL database. Both API and the database will be deployed on Google Cloud Platform with the API using Cloud Run and the MySQL database using Cloud SQL.
